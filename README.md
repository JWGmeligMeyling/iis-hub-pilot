# ![IIS hub pilot project logo](https://github.com/esacinc/iis-hub-pilot/raw/master/iis-hub-pilot/src/main/webapp/static/images/iis-hub-pilot-48x48.png) The Immunization Information Systems (IIS) Hub Pilot Project

# Continuation

The Immunization Registry Inter-Jurisdictional Interoperability Pilot project was officially concluded on September 25th, 2014. No further activity will take place in this Google Code project nor in the associated development resources.

The overall effort has continued as the [Public Health Immunization Data Exchange (PHIZ) project](https://github.com/esacinc/phiz).

## Purpose

The Immunization Information Systems (IIS) Hub Pilot is a proof-of-concept project created for the purpose of demonstrating that a centralized service can be effectively utilized by formerly isolated IIS instances.

## Background

[IIS](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/index.html) is a program run by the [National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)](http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/), an institute within the [Office of Infectious Diseases](http://www.cdc.gov/oid/) of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/). On the technical side, it currently consists of a [SOAP web service definition](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/technical-guidance/SOAP/wsdl.html) currently implemented by and in production for many separate government bodies (States and cities).

In collaboration with several of these existing IIS instances, this project will serve as a proving ground for their ability to interoperate.

This initiative has been sponsored by the CDC and is being managed by the [Office of the National Coordinator for Healthcare IT](http://www.healthit.gov/).
